# USING PYTHON FOR AUTOMATION

# How to read files

# # Here we open "inputFile.txt" and configure it for reading. f is an object of type open()
# f = open('inputFile.txt','r')
# # here we print file content
# print(f.read())
# #closing the file
# f.close()

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#another way for do the same task is printing row by row in a for loop.

# Here we open "inputFile.txt" and configure it for reading. f is an object of type open()
# f = open('inputFile.txt','r')

# count = 0

# here we print file content by rows in a for loop
# for row in f:
# 	print(str(count) + row)
# 	count = count + 1

# #closing the file
# f.close()

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# # first, we open inputFile.txt for reading in f
# f = open('inputFile.txt','r')

# # here we go through f with a for loop and print only those lines that contains a "P" that indicates that studens pass the exams
# for row in f:
# 	row_split = row.split()		# split() method returns a list of strings after breaking the given string by the specified separator

# 	if row_split[2] == 'P':
# 		print(row)

# #closing the file
# f.close()

# writing files in Python

# first, we open inputFile.txt
# f = open('inputFile.txt','r')

# # then, we create passFile.txt for writing those students that have passed the exams
# passFile = open('passFile.txt','w')
# # Here we create failFile.txt for store those students that have failed the exams
# failFile = open('failFile.txt','w')

# # here we go through f with a for loop and print only those lines that contains a "P" that indicates that studens pass the exams
# for row in f:
# 	row_split = row.split()		# split() method returns a list of strings after breaking the given string by the specified separator

# 	if row_split[2] == 'P':
# 		passFile.write(row)		# here we write on passFile.txt those lines that contains a "P"

# 	if row_split[2] == 'F':
# 		failFile.write(row)

# #closing the inputFile
# f.close()
# # after operation, we close passFile.txt
# passFile.close()
# after store information on it, we close failFile.txt
# failFile.close()
